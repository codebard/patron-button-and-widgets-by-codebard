Patreon Button and Plugin allows you to add Patreon Buttons to your content and sidebars, along with offering other Patreon functions. Upgradable to Patron Plugin Pro with patron-only posts and powerful features.

== Description ==

This free plugin will allow you to add a Patreon Button under the content to let your users to become your patrons on Patreon easily. It also will provide two customizable Widgets which you can use in your sidebar.

The buttons and widgets blend in with your theme seamlessly. You can use the new or old Patreon button or you can use your own button image.

You can customize the call to action text over the buttons or turn them on/off, as well as use your own call to action text. You can disable the Buttons under content if you wish to use only the Widgets as well.

You can enter the default account to be used in buttons in plugin options page.

In addition, all authors will be able to add their own Patreon username in their profile to be used for the Buttons, so the Buttons showing under their posts as well as the Author Widget in sidebar will go to their Patreon profile. This feature can be disabled if you wish, from plugin settings, with “Force Site Button instead of Author” option.

More features are planned as they become available in Patreon API.

You can upgrade to Patron Plugin Pro, add the Patron Content Manager addon and enable powerful content-locking options to serve Patron only content from your own website! Patron Plugin Pro will also allow you to put your patrons directly to patron pipeline instead of your profile. Check it out below:

---------------------------

After install, activate the plugin, and that’s it.

You should fill in the Site Patreon Account in plugin settings page. This is the Patreon account which will be used for buttons for any user who did not put their Patreon account in their profile on your site.

You will find the two widgets you can use in your Appearance -> Widgets section. Widgets are customizable

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. A "CB Patreon" menu item will be added to your WordPress Admin Menu
3. At least visit this menu and fill in the "Site/Admin Patreon Account" field with the username/slug you entered to "Personal Patreon url" field in your Patreon Profile. This will be the default Patreon user for all buttons.
4. Done.
5. You can find two widgets in Appearance -> Widgets. 
6. All authors will receive a profile field for Patreon. If they fill in this field in the same manner for themselves like in step #3, then their own personal Patreon account will be used in their buttons instead of Site's.
